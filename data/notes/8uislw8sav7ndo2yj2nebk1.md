## Merge Tools

- Docx merge tools are limited as it looks difficult to merge the xml.

### Linux

- [Linux option](https://github.com/Ventto/odocxmerge)
  - This is specific to linux
  - Only works on linux. Requires `resgen`.
    - Attempted download on MacOS: `resgen: command not found`

### MacOS

- It seems this must be done manually...
- [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYzP_kWq24)
  - This works well enough
  - My use case is only for cover page and the rest of the body

### Windows

- [Windows Option](https://github.com/jamessantiago/DocxMerge)
- Looks simple enough but there are known issues like the ordering of the documents. But it should be navigable. See [issue](https://github.com/jamessantiago/DocxMerge/issues/2).

### Issues

- TOC out of order [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25591517/pandoc-inserting-pages-before-generated-table-of-contents)
