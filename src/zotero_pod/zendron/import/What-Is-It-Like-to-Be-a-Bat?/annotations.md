> Suppose a caterpillar is locked in a sterile safe by someone unfamiliar with insect metamorphosis, and weeks later the safe is reopened, revealing a butterfly. If the person knows that the safe has been shut the whole time, he has reason to believe that the butterfly is or was once the caterpillar, without having any idea in what sense this might be so. (One possibility is that the caterpillar contained a tiny winged parasite that devoured it and grew into the butterfly.) It is conceivable that we are in such a position with regard to physicalism.

> We may not have even a rough idea of how the two referential paths could converge,or what kind of things they might converge on, and a theoretical framework may have to be supplied to enable us to understand this. Without the framework, an air of mysticism surrounds the identification.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : On how #physicalism states mental states "are" states of the body, and "mental events" are "physical events". We don't know how to define this "are"

> If we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience,we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🟣 ) : I'm not sure sure what prevents a theory of #emergence , #complexity ,  #complex-systems , or #epi-phenomena from achieving this.

> But while we are right to leave this point of view aside in seeking a fuller understanding of the external world, we cannot ignore it permanently, since it is the essence of the internal world, and not merely a point of view on it.

> Thus it isa conditionof theirreferring to a common reality that theirmore particular viewpoints are not part of the commonreality that they both apprehend. The reduction can succeed only if the species-specificviewpoint is omittedfrom what is tobe reduced

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🟢 ) : I see this as a #unifying-principle of #reductionism . It allows dissimilar minds to come to agreement. Even humans can disagree entirely on their experience of the same event, but it is almost impossible to disagree and reduced external phenomena.

> If the subjective character of experience is fully comprehensible only from on point of view, then any shift to greater objectivity-that is, less attachment to a specific viewpoint-does not take us nearer to the real nature of the phenomenon: it takes us farther away from it.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : Includes whole sentence from previous page. #reductionism also takes the general case into account. So to describe a single subject objectively would be difficult. But I think we could objectively describe human experience through aggregating subjective experience. Couldn't we get closer to objectivity by saying, a human in x circumstance would most likely experience y. Not entirely objective, but it points in the direction of #objectivity .

> We appear to be faced with a general difficulty about psychophysical reduction. In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the direction of greater objectivity,toward a more accurate view of the real nature of things.This is accomplished by reducing our dependence on individual or species-specific points of view toward the object of investigation.We describe it not in terms of the impressions it makes on our senses,but in terms of its more general effects and of properties detectable by means other than the human senses.The less it depends on a specifically human viewpoint, the more objective is our description. It is possible to follow this path because although the concepts and ideas we employ in thinking about the external world are initially applied from a point of view that involves our perceptual apparatus, they are used by us to refer to things beyond themselves toward which we have the phenomenal point of view. Therefore we can abandon it in favor of another, and still be thinking about the same things.

> We can be compelled to recognize the existenceofsuch facts without being able to state or comprehend them

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : On forever unknowable facts. I am only compelled to believe this for humans in their current form. It is more difficult to make the claim that there are parts of the universe that are unknowable in any sense. This I am less inclined to agree with.

> But one might also believe that there are facts which could not ever be represented or comprehended by human beings,even if the species lasted forever-simply because our structure does not permit us to operate with concepts of the requisite type.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : But if we change our structure, this no longer holds. The definition of human is transitive.

> It would be fine if someone were to develop concepts and a theory that enabled us to think about those things; but such an understanding may be permanently denied to us by the limits of our nature.

- Comment (🔵 ) : Imagine an experience machine, which allows us to somehow sit in the seat of experience of the bat. If this is technologically possible, we are at least closer to what it is like to be a bat.

> The problem is not confined to exotic cases, however,for it exists between one person and another. The subjective character of the experience of a person deaf and blind from birth is not accessible to me, for example, nor presumably is mine to him. This does not prevent us each from believing that the other's experience has such a subjective character.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : We can believe with high probability that other life has experience without ever being able to directly measure their experience.

> The reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.

- Annotator: @Unknown
- Comment (🔵 ) : I don't see how this prevents us from eventually coming up with a theory of experience.

> Without some idea, therefore of what the subjective character of experience is, we cannot know what is required of a physicalist theory.
