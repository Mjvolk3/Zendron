## Future

[[Future|mjvolk3.tasks.future]]

- ğŸ”® Add sync comments to load for a quick fix to make the package useful.

- ğŸ”® Test and probably rewrite sync annotations.
- ğŸ”® Add delete note sync for annotations cache.
- ğŸ”® Add delete meta sync for metadata cache.
- ğŸ”® Add user note to meta sync.
- ğŸ”® Test sync on metadata update and annotations update.
- ğŸ”® Cache comments on sync.
- ğŸ”® Simulate a workflow to make sure comments is working correctly.
- ğŸ”® Add cli. One primary function, sync, with additional functions, remove (comments flag`).
- ğŸ”® Add delete functionality to remove imported data.

## Far Future

- ğŸ”® `dacite`for dictionary to python dataclass. This could be used instead of my current method where I basically use a bunch of getter methods to pluck out data I am interested in while, adding necessary data for pod import.
