## Merge Tools
- Docx merge tools are limited as it looks difficult to merge the xml.

### Linux
- [Linux option](https://github.com/Ventto/odocxmerge)
    - This is specific to linux
    - Only works on linux. Requires `resgen`.
        - Attempted download on MacOS: `resgen: command not found`

### MacOS
- It seems this must be done manually...
- [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYzP_kWq24)
    - This works well enough
    - My use case is only for cover page and the rest of the body

### Windows
- [Windows Option](https://github.com/jamessantiago/DocxMerge)
- Looks simple enough but there are known issues like the ordering of the documents. But it should be navigable. See [issue](https://github.com/jamessantiago/DocxMerge/issues/2).

### Issues
- TOC out of order [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25591517/pandoc-inserting-pages-before-generated-table-of-contents)
